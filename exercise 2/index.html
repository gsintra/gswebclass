        <h1>Ten Principles for Good Design</h1>
        <h2>by Dieter Rams</h2><br> 
    <ol>
        <p><span>1. Good design is <span class="italic">innovative</span><br><br>  
        <p>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. <br>But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>

        <p><span>2. Good design makes a product <span class="italic">useful </span><br><br>  
        <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. <br>Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>

        <p><span>3. Good design is <span class="italic">aesthetic</span> <br><br>  
        <p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. <br>But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>

        <p><span>4. Good design makes a product <span class="italic">understandable</span> <br><br>  
        <p>It clarifies the product's structure. <br>Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>

        <p><span>5. Good design is <span class="italic">unobtrusive</span> <br><br>
        <p>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. <br>Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</p>

        <p><span>6. Good design is <span class="italic">honest</span><br><br>
        <p>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is.<br> It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>

        <p><span>7. Good design is <span class="italic">long-lasting</span><br><br> 
        <p>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.<br> Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society</p>

        <p><span>8. Good design is <span class="italic">thorough</span> down to the last detail <br><br> 
        <p>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance.<br> Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.</p>

        <p><span>9. Good design is <span class="italic">environmentally-friendly </span><br><br>  
        <p>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment.<br> It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>

        <p><span>10. Good design is as <span class="italic">little</span> design as possible <br><br>
        <p>Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.</p>
